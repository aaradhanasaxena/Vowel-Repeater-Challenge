# üîÅ Vowel Repeater Challenge

A fun JavaScript exercise that manipulates strings by repeating vowels based on their occurrence order. This challenge was inspired by a [freeCodeCamp Daily Coding Challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/daily-coding-challenge/2025-09-04) and showcases iterative logic, string manipulation, and clean modular code.

## ‚ú® What It Does

Given a string, the function:
- Repeats each vowel based on its position among vowels (not total characters)
- Preserves the original casing for the first vowel appearance
- Converts repeated vowels to lowercase for visual clarity

### Example
repeatVowels("freeCodeCamp");
// Output: "freeeCooodeeCaaamp"
